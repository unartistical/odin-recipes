A simple webpage made during the fundations course on the Odin Project to showcase basic HTML.

## Self-reflection and Thoughts
This was the first assigment within Odin Project curriculum. I learned how to write basic HTML boilerplate, navigate through the terminal, create directories and files, as well as adding images and links.
